# This example creates a polygonal model of a Cone e visualize the results in a
# VTK render window.
# The program creates the cone, rotates it 360º and closes
# The pipeline  source -> mapper -> actor -> renderer  is typical
# and can be found in most VTK programs

# Import all VTK modules

    # visualization pipeline (it is a source process object); it produces data
    # (output type is vtkPolyData) which other filters may process.

    # We create an instance of vtkPolyDataMapper to map the polygonal data
    # into graphics primitives. We connect the output of the cone source
    # to the input of this mapper.

    coneMapper = vtkPolyDataMapper()
    coneMapper.SetInputConnection(coneSource.GetOutputPort())

    # We create an actor to represent the cone. The actor orchestrates rendering
    # of the mapper's graphics primitives. An actor also refers to properties
    # via a vtkProperty instance, and includes an internal transformation
    # matrix. We set this actor's mapper to be coneMapper which we created
    # above.
